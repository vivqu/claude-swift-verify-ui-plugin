# Verify (Full)

Run full verification by invoking both sub-skills in sequence, then report a combined summary.

## Steps

1. Invoke the `ios-verify-ui:verify-ui` skill (passing `$ARGUMENTS` if provided). Note the result — do not stop if it fails, continue to step 2.

2. Invoke the `ios-verify-ui:verify-test` skill. Note the result.

3. Report a combined summary:
   - Show the UI result (pass or fail with details) and the test result (pass or fail with details).
   - End with a single-line overall verdict: **All checks passed** or **Verification failed** (listing what failed).
